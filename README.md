#***Reconfigurable Anteenas For MIMO Systems:***

----------
###*Abstract*:

----------




MIMO system is an attractive technology for wireless systems. Now Reconfigurable Antenna for MIMO systems improves link
capacity which is an additional feature of this system. In this paper we are going to see Reconfigurable Antennas for MIMO
Systems based on Array system. In Array based Reconfigurable Antennas for MIMO Systems, an array of two printed dipoles
separated by a distance of quarter wavelength are used and each of them are reconfigured in length using pin diode switches.
The switch configuration can be modified in a manner adaptive to changes in the environment. The configuration of the
switches effect the mutual-coupling between the array elements and subsequently the radiation pattern of each antenna,
leading to different degree of pattern diversity which can be used to improve link capacity. A new definition of spatial
correlation is studied to include the effects of antenna mismatch and radiation efficiency when quantifying the benefits of
pattern diversity.
